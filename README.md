# docker-conductor
A way to automate and orchestrate docker deployments

# Installation

`go install github.com/joshrendek/docker-conductor`

# Usage

Run `docker-conductor` inside a directory with a `conductor.yml` in it.

Flags:

```
-f, --force=false: Force a redeploy of everything in the conductor.yml file
-n, --name="": Only run the instruction with this name
-p, --project="": Only run the instruction that are apart of this project
```

#### Healthchecks

You can either run a healthcheck as a command and conductor will replace any instances of `$HOST` with the host or ip.

Or you can run a healthcheck that is a script, for example: `./some_script.sh` - the host will be available as a `$HOST` environment parameter.

If scripts do not `exit 0`, the health check will fail, the reason and output of the script will print to `STDOUT`.

#### Only deploy `test_project`

`docker-conductor -p test_project`

#### Only deploy the instruction named foobar

`docker-conductor -n foobar`

# Example conductor.yml

If you want to use a library image, just specify library infront (check example below)

``` yaml

- name: test redis
  healthcheck: curl $HOST
  hosts:
    - tcp://docker1.example.com:2375
  container:
    name: test-redis
    image: library/redis

- name: Descriptive Service Name
  healthcheck: ./some_script.sh
  project: test_project
  hosts:
    - tcp://docker1.example.com:2375
  container:
    name: running-container-name
    image: private.registry.example.com/yourname/your_image
    environment:
      - FOOBAR=baz
    ports:
      80/tcp: 8080
    volumes:
      - /tmp:/tmp
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8

- name: Descriptive Service Name 2
  hosts:
    - tcp://docker1.example.com:2375
  container:
    name: foobar-baz
    image: private.registry.example.com/yourname/foobar_baz_image
```
